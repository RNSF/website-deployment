<ol>
  <li>I feel like I have a pretty high filter when I talk to people. This obviously makes it harder to connect with others, and makes me stay quiet most of the time. This is where I’m going to experiment with lowering that filter.</li>
  <li>I’m not that good at articulating certain ideas. This is probably a combination of a lack of practice of actually articulating, but also that I haven’t fully thought through a lot of the ideas I want to talk about. This is where I’m going to try to organize those ideas.</li>
  <li>Those are really the two main reasons. But this list didn’t feel complete without a third. So I guess a final reason would be that it will be nice to keep a record of what I’m thinking about at different times in my life. I’m not one to normally keep a lot of records - I don’t take a lot of photos for example. Regardless it will be interesting to see how my future self reacts to what I write here.</li>
</ol>

<p>That’s all for now.</p>

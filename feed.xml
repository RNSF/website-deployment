I’ve poured countless hours over that time into working on game projects. From game jams, to big team efforts, to professional work, to personal projects that never saw the light of day. I watched the youtube channels, read the blogs, learned the engines, but now I think it’s time to take break.</p>

<p>But why? Well, there’s a few reasons…</p>

<h2 id="falling-out-of-love-with-games">Falling Out of Love with Games:</h2>
<p>When I first got into game development I was an avid gamer. I was still clocking hundreds of hours in games like Rocket League, Stardew Valley, Rivals of Aether and Minecraft. Sadly (or probably for the better?) I’m not like that anymore. While once upon a time I’d get hooked on every new game I would buy, now my digital game libraries are filled with a collection of unplayed games collecting virtual dust.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Doing a little reverse engineering on my Steam Replay from 2025, I found that I only spent around 25 hours gaming the whole year. Of course this was only one platform - my time in Minecraft and Mario Odyssey aren’t counted here - but I doubt those contribute to more than 15 hours combined.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This has made working in games feel a little awkward for me. As in, I guess that original driving motivation isn’t really there anymore. Of course, I still enjoy game development itself, but I’m stuggling to find the deeper purpose behind it all. Before it was simple: I liked playing games, so obviously there was value in creating more games. That just doesn’t hold up any longer.</p>

<h2 id="consumerism-and-tech">Consumerism and Tech:</h2>
<p>In 2017, 6000 games released on Steam. In 2025, 20000 games released on Steam. The market is saturated and becoming more saturated every day. This begs the question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do we really need more games? Are there more important problems I can be focusing my energy towards?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Like I wrote in my <a href="/2025/12/24/consumer-software.html">other blog post</a>, the whole world of consumer software has got me feeling pretty jaded lately. Do we really need an increase in the creation and consumption of digitial media? I don’t think thats the direction the world needs to go in right now. Or maybe it’s just not what I need right now, and I’m projecting. But I know there are others out there that also feel like this, I’m just not quite sure how many. Either way something about contributing to the digital media ecosystem doesn’t fully sit right with me right now, even though I feel like games are the least offensive culprit.</p>

<h2 id="the-industry">The Industry:</h2>
<p>The games industry has seen a rough couple years. Honestly, this isn’t really a core reason for me wanting to take a break from games, but it is a contributing factor. The last 4 years have been rough years for the industry, with 2022-2025 seeing over <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2025">35,000 employees laid off</a>. Luckily it seems the indie scene hasn’t been hit QUITE as hard, with <a href="https://howtomarketagame.com/2025/11/04/the-optimistic-case-that-indie-games-are-in-a-golden-age-right-now/">small indie games (4-6 month dev time) doing quite well this year</a>. Although for someone who’s trying to find more meaning in working on games, the idea of creating small games whose main purpose is literaly just to grab your attention for a few hours, doesn’t exactly feel like the best direction to be moving in either.</p>

<p>I’m sure the industry will rebound. Honestly it looks like it’s already starting to a little bit. But if I am going to take a break from games to explore some other paths I feel like now would be a good time to do it. So why not take the chance?</p>

<h2 id="this-isnt-goodbye-forever">This Isn’t Goodbye Forever:</h2>
<p>A lot of these things I still feel quite unsure about. I mean when I tell people I work in games, I often get a response that it sounds pretty cool, and they wish their job was as interesting or as fun as mine. And I do enjoy working on games. It’s just that I wonder if there is something deeper out there for me to do.</p>

<p>Maybe I just don’t appreciate what I have until its gone. But also its not like my portfolio and years of game development experience are just going to vanish overnight if I step away. I’m just not quite sure I want to commit to games just yet. I think Youtuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@CGPGrey">CGP Grey</a> has a pretty good analogy:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s … useful to think of life like fishing - some spots are beautiful (to you) and in some spots your skills will catch fish, others not. But you can’t know where you’d like to spend time until you go there, and you can’t know how many fish you can catch there until you try. The younger you are, the more time you can spend sailing to different spots, and then the older you are the more time you get to spend in places you know you like, refining your abilities to catch fish there.

</blockquote>

<p>I’ll see ya in a bit. I’m going on a fishing trip.</p>

I found that the time that I was spending on the computer was taking away from more meaningful things I could be doing, and was starting to get the in way of my wellbeing. With working another fully remote co-op this semester, I made a decision to do a little experimenting when it came to my relationship with technology. This was comprised of multiple actions primarily aimed at reducing screen time:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Automatically shutting down my PC after 6pm (after working hours). I still had my laptop to complete school work / other tasks that needed to be done after work.</li>
  <li>Using various social media blockers to block infinite scrolling feeds (I’d already been doing this for a while, but did it to a larger extent over the past 4 months).</li>
  <li>Making a larger effort to sign up for additional clubs and one-off events that would get me out of my dorm. I tried a lot of new things this semester including volunteering, salsa dancing, and resistance training; as well as attending various events from table top gaming to tote bag painting to marathons and half marathons.</li>
  <li>Putting zero preassure on myself to be working on programming related side projects.</li>
</ol>

<p>Needless to say, I ended up having a really good time this semester. In fact, this was probably my favourite semester of university since I started 3 years ago. Of course there were other factors that helped: co-op is less stressful than academics, and I’m now quite  acclimated to life at university with this being my 4th year. Regardless, I don’t think anything else I’ve tried has improved my wellbeing quite to the extent that this experiment has.</p>

<p>As I’ve taken a step back this semester, I’ve also noticed that being on a screen just doesn’t seem to be a very fun place to be. The few times I did scroll this semester I really noticed just how bad I felt after. Externally I also started noticing signs that the whole ecosystem of consumer software has fallen off:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Google’s app of the year is Focus Friend: an app designed to force you to spend less time using the other apps on your phone.</li>
  <li>One of the top genres in gaming this year was called “friendslop”</li>
  <li>Oxford Dictionary’s word of the year is “rage bait” (last year it was “brain rot”).</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course most of these things are more vibes based, but you don’t have to search hard to find studies showing the correlation between social media usage and a host of issues from <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9817115/">loneliness</a>, to <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6278213/">suicidal ideation</a>, to <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5003636/">eating disorders</a>.</p>

<p>As a someone who’s wanted to be an indie game developer for over 5 years now, I naturally have consumed a lot of content from other (more successful) indie developers on how to do this. Before I started this experiment, I watched this talk from Jonathan Blow about how to find motivation to work on software projects.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For those that don’t know, Jon developed <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/26800/Braid/">Braid</a>, one of the first major PC indie hits. He’s been programming for over 3 decades, so he knows a few things.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Anyway, near the beginning of the talk he states he believes that “computers are fundamentally depressing” (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgSLRL5OpzY">17:45</a>) and that a lot of technical people are “unhappy for a great percentage of the time they are sitting in front of a computer” (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgSLRL5OpzY">19:20</a>). He then goes on for the next hour discussing metitative techniques (among other things) to cope with the depression caused by computers. But man as I look back on this now do I think… it seems like it would be a lot easier to just avoid using the computer in the first place.</p>

<p>That’s what I did. And it worked.</p>

<p>Until next time,</p>

<ol>
  <li>I feel like I have a pretty high filter when I talk to people. This obviously makes it harder to connect with others, and makes me stay quiet most of the time. This is where I’m going to experiment with lowering that filter.</li>
  <li>I’m not that good at articulating certain ideas. This is probably a combination of a lack of practice of actually articulating, but also that I haven’t fully thought through a lot of the ideas I want to talk about. This is where I’m going to try to organize those ideas.</li>
  <li>Those are really the two main reasons. But this list didn’t feel complete without a third. So I guess a final reason would be that it will be nice to keep a record of what I’m thinking about at different times in my life. I’m not one to normally keep a lot of records - I don’t take a lot of photos for example. Regardless it will be interesting to see how my future self reacts to what I write here.</li>
</ol>

<p>That’s all for now.</p>

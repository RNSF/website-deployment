    <p>I’ve experimented the last 4 months with reducing my screen time as much as possible. I found that the time that I was spending on the computer was taking away from more meaningful things I could be doing, and was starting to get the in way of my wellbeing. With working another fully remote co-op this semester, I made a decision to do a little experimenting when it came to my relationship with technology. This was comprised of multiple actions primarily aimed at reducing screen time:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Automatically shutting down my PC after 6pm (after working hours). I still had my laptop to complete school work / other tasks that needed to be done after work.</li>
  <li>Using various social media blockers to block infinite scrolling feeds (I’d already been doing this for a while, but did it to a larger extent over the past 4 months).</li>
  <li>Making a larger effort to sign up for additional clubs and one-off events that would get me out of my dorm. I tried a lot of new things this semester including volunteering, salsa dancing, and resistance training; as well as attending various events from table top gaming to tote bag painting to marathons and half marathons.</li>
  <li>Putting zero preassure on myself to be working on programming related side projects.</li>
</ol>

<p>Needless to say, I ended up having a really good time this semester. In fact, this was probably my favourite semester of university since I started 3 years ago. Of course there were other factors that helped: co-op is less stressful than academics, and I’m now quite  acclimated to life at university with this being my 4th year. Regardless, I don’t think anything else I’ve tried has improved my wellbeing quite to the extent that this experiment has.</p>

<p>As I’ve taken a step back this semester, I’ve also noticed that being on a screen just doesn’t seem to be a very fun place to be. The few times I did scroll this semester I really noticed just how bad I felt after. Externally I also started noticing signs that the whole ecosystem of consumer software has fallen off:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Google’s app of the year is Focus Friend: an app designed to force you to spend less time using the other apps on your phone.</li>
  <li>One of the top genres in gaming this year was called “friendslop”</li>
  <li>Oxford Dictionary’s word of the year is “rage bait” (last year it was “brain rot”).</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course most of these things are more vibes based, but you don’t have to search hard to find studies showing the correlation between social media usage and a host of issues from <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9817115/">loneliness</a>, to <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6278213/">suicidal ideation</a>, to <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5003636/">eating disorders</a>.</p>

<p>As a someone who’s wanted to be an indie game developer for over 5 years now, I naturally have consumed a lot of content from other (more successful) indie developers on how to do this. Before I started this experiment, I watched this talk from Jonathan Blow about how to find motivation to work on software projects.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For those that don’t know, Jon developed <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/26800/Braid/">Braid</a>, one of the first major PC indie hits. He’s been programming for over 3 decades, so he knows a few things.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Anyway, near the beginning of the talk he states he believes that “computers are fundamentally depressing” (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgSLRL5OpzY">17:45</a>) and that a lot of technical people are “unhappy for a great percentage of the time they are sitting in front of a computer” (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgSLRL5OpzY">19:20</a>). He then goes on for the next hour discussing metitative techniques (among other things) to cope with the depression caused by computers. But man as I look back on this now do I think… it seems like it would be a lot easier to just avoid using the computer in the first place.</p>

<p>That’s what I did. And it worked.</p>

<p>Until next time,</p>
